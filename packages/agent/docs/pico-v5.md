# Pico5 specification

Pico5 is a durable, extensible agent harness. This document is normative.
Pico5 uses existing package types as follows:

```ts
import type { Context, JsonValue } from "@earendil-works/chord";
import type { Op } from "@earendil-works/chord/delta";
import type {
  Message as ModelMessage,
  TextContent,
  Tool,
  ToolReference,
} from "@earendil-works/pi-ai";

type JsonObject = { [key: string]: JsonValue };
type StoredError = { message: string; detail?: JsonValue };
```

Pico5 targets the transcript `SystemMessage` contract from pi-ai PR
[#9548](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9548). `Message` includes that
type once the PR lands.

The core rule is:

> A Session atomically commits immutable entries, full task records, and
> Chord-tracked documents. Only committed state is observable.

## 1. Terms and invariants

- A **Session** owns one mutation line, conversations, entries, tasks, inputs,
  and documents.
- A **conversation** is a transcript scope. It may fork another conversation.
- An **entry** is an immutable transcript record.
- A **task** is a durable state machine attached to one conversation.
- A **document** is mutable JSON state represented by Chord operations and
  occasional complete bases.
- A **definition** is a typed token describing one document or document family.
- A **source** exposes committed document changes to Chord without exposing a
  mutable object.

Required invariants:

1. One Session commit is atomic across all record and document writes.
2. A document update is published only after its storage commit succeeds.
3. All visible progress is durable. There is no volatile publication path.
4. External effects do not run inside the Session mutation transaction.
5. Entries and IDs are immutable and never reused after a committed write.
6. Document drafts and assigned mutable objects must not escape their
   transaction. This restriction is initially documented, not enforced by a
   membrane.
7. The mutation line remains held through storage settlement and committed-state
   adoption. Listener callbacks run later, off the line.
8. A failure after document flush, including checkpoint or storage failure, is
   fatal to the open Session. It publishes nothing and must be reopened.

## 2. Core records

The concrete JSON representations may add bookkeeping fields, but must preserve
these contracts.

```ts
type Id = number;
type Seq = number;

type Conversation = {
  readonly id: Id;
  readonly parent?: {
    readonly conversationId: Id;
    readonly at: Id;
  };
  readonly owner?: {
    readonly conversationId: Id;
    readonly taskId: Id;
  };
};

type RequestMessage = ModelMessage;
```

The referenced pi-ai member is:

```ts
interface SystemMessage {
  role: "system";
  content: string | TextContent[];
  sections?: Record<string, string | null>;
  toolsAdded?: Tool[];
  toolsRemoved?: ToolReference[];
  timestamp: number;
}
```

`content` is the base prompt on the leading message and additional instruction
text on later messages. `sections` is an ordered named patch: a string adds or
replaces a section, while `null` removes it. `toolsRemoved` is applied before
`toolsAdded` within one message. Replaying every system message in transcript
order yields the effective prompt and tool set.

```ts
type ContextEdit = {
  readonly target: Id;
  readonly action: "omit" | "replace";
  readonly messages?: readonly RequestMessage[];
};

type Entry = {
  readonly id: Id;
  readonly conversationId: Id;
  readonly kind: string;
  readonly model?: readonly RequestMessage[];
  readonly data?: JsonValue;
  readonly head?: Id;
  readonly edits?: readonly ContextEdit[];
  readonly byTaskId?: Id;
};

type EntryDraft = Omit<Entry, "id" | "conversationId" | "byTaskId" | "head"> & {
  readonly head?: Id | "self";
};

type Input = {
  readonly id: Id;
  readonly conversationId: Id;
  readonly requestId?: string;
  readonly status: "queued" | "placed" | "done" | "unanswered";
  readonly entry?: Id;
  readonly answer?: Id;
  readonly reason?: string;
  readonly detail?: JsonValue;
};
```

Conversation history parenting and task ownership are separate:

- `parent` controls inherited entries and historical documents.
- `owner` controls task authorization, subtree abort, and subtree idle waits.

A conversation's owner remains recorded after the owning task becomes terminal.

### 2.1 Entries and context

Entry IDs are Session-global and ordered. `parent.at` is an entry in the parent
history visible to the child.

The active transcript is the raw entry range from the newest applicable `head`
through the tail. A head on an entry changes subsequent context; it does not
remove older entries from storage. Fork traversal is child entries followed by
parent entries through each `parent.at` cap.

Context derivation:

1. Find the newest visible entry `H` at or before the cutoff that has `head`.
2. Let `from = H.head`, or transcript start when `H` is absent.
3. Scan visible entries from `from` through the cutoff.
4. For each target, the newest edit in that range wins. `omit` contributes no
   model messages; `replace` contributes its `messages` instead of the target's.
5. If `H` exists, context entries are `H` followed by non-head entries in the
   range. Otherwise they are the range.
6. Keep every positional system message and its tool/section changes.
7. Order tool results by assistant tool-call order.
8. Synthesize missing tool results after a fork when required by the provider
   message protocol.
9. Exclude model-less entries and assistant messages with `aborted`, `error`, or
   `deferred` stop reasons from future provider requests.

Views carry raw active entries. UI reduction and model-context reduction are
separate consumers. Older stored history is available through cursor-based
entry scans.

## 3. Documents

### 3.1 Definitions

Scope directly determines document ownership and lifetime. Only conversation
documents declare history and fork behavior.

```ts
type LatestConversationSemantics = {
  readonly scope: "conversation";
  readonly history: "latest";
  readonly fork: "current" | "initial";
};

type RewindableConversationSemantics = {
  readonly scope: "conversation";
  readonly history: "rewindable";
  readonly fork: "asOf" | "current" | "initial";
};

type DocumentSemantics =
  | { readonly scope: "session" }
  | LatestConversationSemantics
  | RewindableConversationSemantics
  | { readonly scope: "task" };

type CommonDocDefinition<T extends JsonObject> = {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly version: number;
  initial(): T;
  migrate?(value: JsonObject, fromVersion: number): T;
  checkpointWhen?(value: Readonly<T>, ops: readonly Op[]): boolean;
};

type DocDefinition<T extends JsonObject> =
  CommonDocDefinition<T> & DocumentSemantics;

type DocFamilyDefinition<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue> =
  Omit<CommonDocDefinition<T>, "initial"> & DocumentSemantics & {
    readonly family: true;
    initial(input: I): T;
  };

function defineDoc<T extends JsonObject>(
  definition: CommonDocDefinition<T> & RewindableConversationSemantics,
): RewindableDocToken<T>;
function defineDoc<T extends JsonObject>(definition: DocDefinition<T>): DocToken<T>;

function defineDocFamily<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue>(
  definition: Omit<CommonDocDefinition<T>, "initial"> &
    RewindableConversationSemantics & {
      readonly family: true;
      initial(input: I): T;
    },
): RewindableDocFamilyToken<T, I>;
function defineDocFamily<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue>(
  definition: DocFamilyDefinition<T, I>,
): DocFamilyToken<T, I>;

declare const docType: unique symbol;
interface DocToken<T extends JsonObject> {
  readonly definition: DocDefinition<T>;
  readonly [docType]?: T;
}
interface RewindableDocToken<T extends JsonObject> extends DocToken<T> {
  readonly definition: CommonDocDefinition<T> & RewindableConversationSemantics;
}
interface DocFamilyToken<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue> {
  readonly definition: DocFamilyDefinition<T, I>;
  readonly [docType]?: T;
}
interface RewindableDocFamilyToken<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue>
  extends DocFamilyToken<T, I> {
  readonly definition: Omit<CommonDocDefinition<T>, "initial"> &
    RewindableConversationSemantics & {
      readonly family: true;
      initial(input: I): T;
    };
}
type AnyDocToken = DocToken<JsonObject> | DocFamilyToken<JsonObject, JsonValue>;
```

Validation rules:

- Definition IDs are unique among loaded definitions.
- Versions are positive integers.
- Session documents are current-only and belong to the Session. Closing and
  reopening the Session does not retire them.
- Conversation documents declare `history` and `fork`; `fork: "asOf"` requires
  `history: "rewindable"`.
- Task documents are current-only, are never copied by a conversation fork, and
  retire atomically when their task becomes terminal.
- `initial()` and `migrate()` return JSON objects.

`checkpointWhen()` only selects complete storage bases to bound replay. It does
not change scope, lifetime, history, or fork semantics.

Concrete built-in document grouping and semantics are declared when the built-in
definitions are implemented. The generic document mechanism does not special
case model, tool, inbox, or presentation state.

### 3.2 Identity

A persisted document instance has:

```ts
type DocumentIdentity = {
  readonly id: Id;                 // unique incarnation
  readonly definitionId: string;
  readonly definitionVersion: number;
  readonly instanceId?: string;    // families only
} & (
  | { readonly scope: { readonly kind: "session" } }
  | ({ readonly scope: { readonly kind: "conversation"; readonly conversationId: Id } } & (
      | { readonly history: "latest"; readonly fork: "current" | "initial" }
      | {
          readonly history: "rewindable";
          readonly fork: "asOf" | "current" | "initial";
        }
    ))
  | { readonly scope: { readonly kind: "task"; readonly taskId: Id } }
);

type DocumentMetadata = DocumentIdentity & {
  readonly createdAt: Seq;         // stamped by the committing storage
  readonly retiredAt?: Seq;
};
```

`id` is never reused. Retiring and recreating the same logical definition,
scope, and instance ID creates a new incarnation.

A singleton is identified logically by definition and scope. A family is
identified logically by definition, scope, and `instanceId`. Persisted metadata
records the scope and conversation history/fork semantics so absent plugin code
does not make existing data disappear.

### 3.3 Access and creation

There is no mutable `session.document()` API.

```ts
interface Session extends DocumentObserver {
  commit<T>(
    change: (tx: Tx) => T | Promise<T>,
    context: Context,
  ): Promise<T>;

  close(context: Context): Promise<void>;

  snapshot<T extends JsonObject>(
    token: DocToken<T>,
    target: DocTarget,
    context: Context,
  ): Promise<Readonly<T>>;

  snapshot<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue>(
    token: DocFamilyToken<T, I>,
    target: FamilyTarget<I>,
    context: Context,
  ): Promise<Readonly<T>>;

  snapshotAsOf<T extends JsonObject>(
    token: RewindableDocToken<T>,
    conversationId: Id,
    at: Id,
    context: Context,
  ): Promise<Readonly<T> | undefined>;

  snapshotAsOf<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue>(
    token: RewindableDocFamilyToken<T, I>,
    target: HistoricalFamilyTarget,
    at: Id,
    context: Context,
  ): Promise<Readonly<T> | undefined>;

  documentSource<T extends JsonObject>(
    token: DocToken<T>,
    target: DocTarget,
    context: Context,
  ): Promise<DocumentSource<T>>;

  documentSource<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue>(
    token: DocFamilyToken<T, I>,
    target: FamilyTarget<I>,
    context: Context,
  ): Promise<DocumentSource<T>>;
}

interface Tx {
  conversation(id: Id): Promise<Conversation | undefined>;
  entry(id: Id): Promise<Entry | undefined>;
  input(id: Id): Promise<Input | undefined>;
  task(id: Id): Promise<Task<JsonValue, JsonValue, JsonValue> | undefined>;
  scanEntries(query: EntryQuery): Promise<readonly Entry[]>;
  scanTasks(query: TaskQuery): Promise<readonly Task<JsonValue, JsonValue, JsonValue>[]>;

  createConversation(value: Omit<Conversation, "id">): Conversation;
  appendEntry(conversationId: Id, value: EntryDraft): Entry;
  createInput(value: Omit<Input, "id">): Input;
  setInput(value: Input): void;
  createTask<I, S extends { phase: string }, R, H extends object>(
    kind: TaskKind<I, S, R, H>, input: I, options?: TaskOptions,
  ): TaskRef<R>;
  setTask(value: Task<JsonValue, JsonValue, JsonValue>): void;

  doc<T extends JsonObject>(token: DocToken<T>, target: DocTarget): Promise<T>;
  doc<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue>(token: DocFamilyToken<T, I>, target: FamilyTarget<I>): Promise<T>;
  retireDoc<T extends JsonObject>(token: DocToken<T>, target: DocTarget): void;
  retireDoc<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue>(token: DocFamilyToken<T, I>, target: FamilyKey): void;
}

type DocTarget =
  | { readonly scope: "session" }
  | { readonly scope: "conversation"; readonly conversationId: Id }
  | { readonly scope: "task"; readonly taskId: Id };

type FamilyKey = DocTarget & { readonly instanceId: string };

type FamilyTarget<I> = FamilyKey & { readonly initial: I };

type HistoricalFamilyTarget = {
  readonly scope: "conversation";
  readonly conversationId: Id;
  readonly instanceId: string;
};
```

Every normal access is get-or-create:

- Existing instances are loaded without rewriting them.
- Missing instances are created in a serialized commit with an initial base.
- Concurrent acquisition initializes once.
- The target scope must match the token's declared scope.
- Task-scoped access validates against the transaction's latest candidate task
  record, falling back to committed state. This internal validation is not a
  caller table read and does not trigger `ReadAfterWrite`. Its conversation is
  derived from the task record rather than repeated in the target.
- A terminal candidate rejects later task-document access. Terminal settlement
  retires both existing task documents and task documents created earlier in the
  same transaction.
- `snapshot()` returns a detached JSON copy.
- `documentSource()` returns an opaque committed source.
- `tx.doc()` returns the transaction's mutable tracked draft.
- Historical reads never create documents in the past.

A family initializer input matters only on first creation. Later accesses must
supply the same logical target; their `initial` value is ignored.

`snapshotAsOf()` is available only for rewindable conversation documents. It
validates that `at` is visible through the requested conversation's ancestry,
selects the ancestor conversation that owns that entry, then finds the logical
singleton/family incarnation whose creation/retirement interval contains the
entry's commit. It never starts from today's incarnation and never creates an
instance. It returns `undefined` when no such instance existed.

After `B` forks `A` at entry `E`, asking for `B`'s state at inherited `E` reads
`A`'s historical instance; `B`'s copied incarnation was created later. If an
instance was retired and recreated, historical lookup selects the incarnation
alive at the target commit.

### 3.4 Mutation ownership

Chord mutates the tracked working object immediately while retaining the
previous baseline until flush.

Transaction behavior:

```text
begin transaction
  acquire document drafts
  mutate ordinary JSON
callback fails
  restore each changed tracker from its unchanged baseline
callback succeeds
  flush each changed tracker -> incremental ops + candidate value
  Storage.commit evaluates each ordinary mutation's checkpoint predicate exactly once
  and persists the selected representation while the Session line remains held
storage succeeds
  adopt committed baselines and enqueue publication while holding the line
  release the line; invoke listeners later
post-flush or storage failure
  poison Session; publish nothing; close/reopen required
```

No defensive document copy is required solely for storage failure because the
open Session cannot continue after that failure.

Unsupported:

```ts
let escaped: LiveState;
await session.commit(async tx => {
  escaped = await tx.doc(LiveDoc, { scope: "conversation", conversationId });
});
escaped.message = message; // unsupported
```

The same rule applies to nested proxies and mutable objects assigned into a
document.

### 3.5 Bases and checkpoints

Creation always stores a complete base.

For an ordinary later mutation, the definition alone decides whether the
storage record is a base:

```ts
const useBase = definition.checkpointWhen?.(candidateValue, ops) ?? false;
```

Storage evaluates this predicate exactly once. The write carries
`base: "checkpoint"`. Creation and version transitions carry `base: "required"` and
do not call the predicate. Storage receives the incremental ops and borrowed
candidate value, then serializes only the selected representation:

```text
required or predicate true -> persist complete value as a base
otherwise                  -> persist ops
```

- For Session, task, and latest conversation documents, a committed base permits
  physical reclamation of older records.
- For rewindable conversation documents, bases bound replay but never permit
  removal of addressable history.
- A definition that never checkpoints may create an unbounded replay tail. That
  is a definition bug, not a backend heuristic.
- Storage does not count encoded bytes, compare against `initial()`, or invent
  checkpoints.

A high-churn live document can checkpoint when it becomes empty:

```ts
checkpointWhen: (value, _ops) =>
  value.message === undefined &&
  value.tools.length === 0
```

### 3.6 Versions and migrations

One migration callback handles every supported older version.

```text
stored == token -> use value
stored < token  -> call migrate(value, storedVersion)
stored > token  -> reject typed access
no migrate      -> reject older stored version
```

`migrate()` is pure and returns a complete current-version value.

- A current-only document persists the migrated value as a required
  current-version base.
- Rewindable history is not rewritten. Current and historical reconstructed
  values are migrated after replay.
- The first mutation of a migrated rewindable value stores a required
  current-version base before subsequent current-version deltas.
- A fork stores the migrated value as the child's initial current-version base.
- Missing plugin definitions preserve stored instances and bytes.

### 3.7 Forks

A conversation fork points to one concrete visible entry `E`.

The child transcript includes entries through `E`, even if the same commit also
appended later entries. Document state at `E` is the final state of the commit
containing `E`. Different document states require separate commits.

Each conversation document follows its definition:

| conversation setting | child value |
|---|---|
| `fork: "asOf"` | parent value at `E`'s commit |
| `fork: "current"` | parent value when the fork commit runs |
| `fork: "initial"` | no copied instance; initializer on first child access |

`current` and `asOf` copy logically present conversation singleton and family
instances, preserving unknown definitions and their stored versions. Copied
values become independent child instances with new IDs and initial bases.
`initial` copies no instance; first access in the child creates it from the
loaded definition. Task documents and tasks are never copied. Session documents
remain shared and are not rewindable.

## 4. Transactions and storage ownership

A Session commit callback may be asynchronous. It owns the Session mutation
line through callback execution, preparation, storage settlement, committed
baseline adoption, and publication enqueue. Listener callbacks run later.
External model, process, tool, network, and human effects run outside it.

```ts
await session.commit(async tx => {
  const input = await tx.input(inputId);            // table read
  const live = await tx.doc(LiveDoc, { scope: "conversation", conversationId });

  const entry = tx.appendEntry(conversationId, message); // first table write
  live.message = undefined;                         // document mutation remains valid
  tx.setInput({ ...input, status: "done", answer: entry.id });
}, context);
```

Mutation admission occurs on the Session line before a commit callback or
get-or-create acquisition starts. Closing seals mutation admission and task
reservation. Already-admitted commits settle before storage closes. Once a
commit is admitted, caller cancellation does not interrupt storage settlement or
undo the commit. Cancelling a close wait does not reopen admission.

Table rules:

- Tables are conversations, entries, tasks, and inputs.
- Table reads are allowed before the first table write.
- Any table read after the first table write throws `ReadAfterWrite`.
- Document access and read-your-writes remain available after table writes.
- Creation methods return their created ID/record; callers do not read it back.

Storage ownership:

- Commit arguments are borrowed until `Storage.commit()` settles.
- Anything retained after settlement is detached first.
- Memory storage recursively copies retained JSON containers.
- JSONL and SQLite detach through serialization and decoded indexes.
- Every storage read returns a detached JSON value.
- Immutable strings may be shared; mutable arrays and objects may not.

## 5. Tasks

### 5.1 Definition

```ts
type LiveTask<S> = {
  readonly status: "pending" | "running";
  readonly checkpoint: S;
};

type TaskOutcome<R> =
  | { readonly status: "completed"; readonly result: R }
  | { readonly status: "failed"; readonly error: StoredError; readonly result?: R }
  | { readonly status: "aborted"; readonly reason?: string; readonly result?: R }
  | { readonly status: "orphaned"; readonly reason: string }
  | { readonly status: "faulted"; readonly error: StoredError };

type TerminalTask<R> = {
  readonly status: "terminal";
  readonly outcome: TaskOutcome<R>;
};

type Task<I, S, R> = {
  readonly id: Id;
  readonly conversationId: Id;
  readonly kind: string;
  readonly version: number;
  readonly input: I;
  readonly state: LiveTask<S> | TerminalTask<R>;
  readonly after: readonly Id[];
  readonly background: boolean;
  readonly abortRequested: boolean;
  readonly memos?: Readonly<Record<string, JsonValue>>; // live tasks only
};

type RunningTask<I, S, R> = Task<I, S, R> & {
  readonly state: LiveTask<S> & { readonly status: "running" };
};

interface HookRunner<H extends object> {
  each<K extends keyof H>(name: K, invoke: (handler: H[K]) => void | Promise<void>): Promise<void>;
}

type PhaseHandler<I, P, S, R, H extends object> = (
  task: RunningTask<I, P, R>,
  runtime: TaskRuntime<I, S, R, H>,
  context: Context,
) => Promise<void>;

interface TaskRuntime<I, S, R, H extends object> extends DocumentObserver {
  readonly taskId: Id;
  readonly conversationId: Id;
  readonly signal: AbortSignal;
  readonly hooks: HookRunner<H>;

  commit(
    change: (tx: Tx, current: RunningTask<I, S, R>) => void | Promise<void>,
    context: Context,
  ): Promise<void>;

  memo<T extends JsonValue>(name: string, context: Context): Promise<T | undefined>;
  memo<T extends JsonValue>(name: string, candidate: T, context: Context): Promise<T>;
  sleep(until: number, context: Context): Promise<void>;
}

type TaskDefinition<I, S extends { phase: string }, R, H extends object> = {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly version: number;
  initial(input: I): S;
  readonly phases: {
    [P in S["phase"]]: PhaseHandler<I, Extract<S, { phase: P }>, S, R, H>;
  };
  abort(task: Task<I, S, R>, runtime: TaskRuntime<I, S, R, H>, context: Context): Promise<void>;
  migrate?(input: JsonValue, checkpoint: JsonValue, fromVersion: number): {
    input: I;
    checkpoint: S;
  };
  readonly hooks?: H;
};

interface TaskKind<I, S extends { phase: string }, R, H extends object> {
  readonly definition: TaskDefinition<I, S, R, H>;
}

declare const taskResultType: unique symbol;
type TaskRef<R> = { readonly id: Id; readonly [taskResultType]?: R };
type TaskOptions = {
  readonly conversationId?: Id;
  readonly after?: readonly Id[];
  readonly background?: boolean;
};

function defineTask<I, S extends { phase: string }, R, H extends object = {}>(
  definition: TaskDefinition<I, S, R, H>,
): TaskKind<I, S, R, H>;
```

The phase map is exhaustive and phase-narrowed. A handler may perform several
commits around one effect, but each durable checkpoint is a full replacement.
`TaskRuntime.commit()` rereads and gates the current durable task on the Session
line before invoking its callback. Transaction methods replace its checkpoint
or write its terminal outcome.

Reservation durably changes `pending` to `running`. One invocation runs phase
handlers in sequence; checkpoint commits retain `running`. After a handler
settles, the scheduler rereads the task and applies the first matching rule:

1. Terminal: stop.
2. Session closing: stop; preserve the checkpoint and any abort mark for reopen.
3. Run mode with a durable abort mark: end and join the run invocation, then
   dispatch a fresh abort invocation.
4. Uncaught error: write terminal `faulted`.
5. Checkpoint changed, including progress within the same phase: invoke its
   phase handler in the same task invocation.
6. Checkpoint unchanged: write terminal `faulted` because no durable progress
   was made.

On open, orphan reconciliation changes surviving `running` tasks back to
`pending`, preserving their checkpoint and abort mark. Task migration then runs
before dispatch. One callback handles every supported older version; newer or
unmigratable live tasks become orphaned.
`close()` marks the runtime closing, seals admission and reservation, signals and
joins invocations, rejects later runtime commits, writes no task outcome, and
then closes storage. Closing starts no fresh phase or abort invocation. It does not set
abort marks, terminalize tasks, retire task documents, or publish document
retirement. Session-owned watches stop. The hosting layer withdraws services and
detaches clients; reconnecting to a reopened Session hydrates the last committed
state and resumes recovery from its durable checkpoints.

### 5.2 Effect sandwich

```text
commit intent phase
perform external effect
commit outcome or next phase
```

Reopening in an intent phase means the effect may have happened. The phase
handler retries safely, polls an external handle, or records interruption.
Deferred providers are represented by a durable phase containing their handle
and next poll time.

Runtime-owned memos are small first-writer-wins values stored in the live task
envelope. Candidate insertion and reading the winner are one Session commit, so
concurrent candidates return the same durable winner. Memos survive checkpoints
and disappear in the terminal replacement. Bulk progress belongs in a document.

### 5.3 Terminal tasks and dependencies

The terminal task record is the durable result receipt. Its result may directly
contain a small value or reference an entry:

```ts
{ status: "completed", result: { entryId: toolResultId } }
```

A terminal transition atomically:

1. Writes the terminal task record.
2. Appends any result entries.
3. Retires all documents scoped to that task.
4. Resolves any inputs settled by the task.

The execution checkpoint and memos disappear from the terminal representation.
Terminal records remain queryable for dependencies, waiters, inspection, and
reopen. A normal run becomes eligible when every `after` task is terminal. An abort
mark bypasses dependencies so pending work can always reach its abort handler.

### 5.4 Scheduler, abort, and ownership

The scheduler serially reserves eligible tasks, then runs handlers off the
Session line. One in-memory `TaskInvocation` contains mode, abort controller,
and completion promise.

Abort protocol:

```text
commit abortRequested
signal and join active run invocation
start a fresh abort invocation
abort handler commits terminal outcome
```

A run invocation may not commit after its durable abort mark appears. Every
runtime operation rejects after its owning invocation ends, even while the
Session remains open. Returning from one phase handler does not end an invocation
that continues into another phase. Invocation mode is volatile and derived from
the durable mark on reopen. Cancelling one caller's `Context` only cancels
that call or wait; it does not durably abort shared work unless the invoked API
commits an abort mark.

A task may create owned conversations. Abort and idle operations traverse the
conversation ownership tree. History parents are irrelevant to this traversal.
Background tasks do not block ordinary idle waits and survive ordinary
conversation abort unless explicitly included.

Initial task/document/entry definitions are registered before open performs
migration or orphan reconciliation. Dynamic registration begins only after that
pass. Unknown or unmigratable live task kinds become terminal `orphaned`;
affected inputs become unanswered, any matching active turn control is cleared,
task-scoped documents retire, and a visible notice entry is appended in one
commit. Faulting a turn task performs the same control/input cleanup with a
`faulted` outcome.

## 6. Inputs and inbox

Input records back awaitable host handles. The inbox itself is an ordered
conversation document containing tagged items:

```ts
type InboxItem =
  | { readonly id: Id; readonly mode: "steer" | "followUp"; readonly input: ModelMessage }
  | { readonly id: Id; readonly mode: "write"; readonly entry: EntryDraft };
```

A built-in turn-control document has an optional `active` value naming the task
currently responsible for the turn and its placed input IDs. `active !==
undefined` defines `busy`; get-or-create of the idle document does not. The
value remains active while generation, tools, and post-tools hand work to one
another.

Admission and terminal transitions:

| action | input state | other writes |
|---|---|---|
| idle `send` | `placed`, with user entry | create turn controller/generation |
| busy `send` | `queued` | append steer/follow-up inbox item |
| idle passive `write` | `done`, with entry | append entry; no turn |
| busy passive `write` | `queued` | append write inbox item |
| boundary places user item | `placed`, with entry | add ID to current/successor turn |
| boundary places write | `done`, with entry | append entry |
| turn answers | `done`, with answer entry | clear/hand off turn controller |
| turn fails or aborts | `unanswered`, with reason | clear/hand off turn controller |
| withdraw queued item | `unanswered`, reason `aborted` | remove inbox item |
| stale item | `unanswered`, reason `stale` | remove inbox item |

`requestId` deduplicates within one conversation before any write. Busy send
with `whenBusy: "reject"` writes nothing and reports `ConversationBusy`. Before
an idle send places its own entry, it runs a final boundary to drain any older
eligible queued items. A handle waits until `done` or `unanswered`; abort
withdraws only a still-queued input and otherwise reports that placement already
occurred. Conversation abort withdraws queued steer/follow-up inputs but keeps
passive writes for later placement.

Boundary selection is deterministic by item ID:

| boundary | write | steer | follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| `postTools` | all | first/all by mode | none |
| `final` | all | first/all by mode | first/all by mode |

A queued self-head write cuts older pending user items: those inputs become
stale, the write is placed, and the current turn terminates. Other head writes
whose target predates the caller's newest known head are stale.

At ordinary `postTools`, generation continues even with no queued trigger;
selected steer IDs join that continuation. A terminating/handoff post-tools
boundary uses final behavior instead. At `final`, the current turn's placed
inputs settle first; selected user IDs start one successor generation. Writes
never trigger generation by themselves. A final boundary without continuation
or user triggers leaves the conversation idle.

Selected and stale items are removed positionally while retained item order is
preserved.
Chord must encode scattered removals without retransmitting retained payloads.
The exact tracker optimization is implementation work; IDs are not substituted
for positional inbox semantics.

## 7. Hooks, tools, and system sections

### 7.1 Hooks

A hook is a typed question asked by a task before it commits a decision. Hooks
are declared by task kind and registered in registration order Session-wide or
for a conversation and its owned subtree. They run off the line; a crash before
the consuming commit may rerun them. Abort errors always propagate.

| hook | composition | ordinary throw |
|---|---|---|
| system instructions | all; draft changes compose; last tool override wins | roll back that handler, report, continue |
| `beforeRequest` | replacement chain | report, continue |
| `afterResponse` | all observers | report, continue |
| `onYield` | first continuation wins | report, continue |
| `beforeTool` | call replacement chain; first block wins | block tool with error text |
| `afterTool` | result replacement chain | report, continue |
| `afterTools` | all observers | report, continue |
| `beforeCollapse` | first decision wins | report, continue |

Hooks use task memos for durable first-writer-wins decisions. There is no public
semantic event channel; current UI status is document state.

### 7.2 Tools

Tools are dynamically registered declarations with name, description, JSON
schema, replay policy, and execute function. A tool call is accepted only if it
was offered in the request's effective system/tool history. Arguments are
validated before and after `beforeTool` hooks.

After hooks and validation, the tool task durably records the final call and
resolved replay policy before execution. Recovery does not rerun `beforeTool`
and does not let a changed registry declaration alter that stored policy.

A tool executes in a durable task. It may:

- write bounded progress/output to a presentation or task-scoped document;
- commit memos;
- create and wait for tasks;
- create owned conversations;
- observe documents for which it has a token/reference;
- return bounded model content and separate diagnostic details.

A tool result may request `addTools`, `terminate`, or `handoff`. Post-tools
applies added tool names to configured loadout, uses a final boundary for
terminate/handoff, and writes a headed handoff entry when requested.

On reopen, a tool reruns only when both its stored intent policy and the current
registered declaration say `safe`. A current `unsafe` declaration may veto a
stored-safe replay; a current-safe declaration never upgrades stored unsafe.
Every other orphaned effect produces an interrupted result containing the
durable partial output. Completed, failed, and aborted
tool terminal outcomes retain their tool-result entry ID for post-tools.

### 7.3 System sections and dynamic tools

Pico stores prompt and tool changes directly as PR #9548 `SystemMessage` values
at their transcript positions:

```ts
type SystemEntry = Entry & {
  readonly kind: "pi.system";
  readonly model: readonly [SystemMessage];
};

const baseline: SystemMessage = {
  role: "system",
  content: basePrompt,
  sections: { persona: renderedPersona, cwd: renderedCwd },
  toolsAdded: allEffectiveTools,
  timestamp: now,
};

const delta: SystemMessage = {
  role: "system",
  content: "",
  sections: { cwd: nextRenderedCwd, legacy: null },
  toolsRemoved: [{ name: "read" }],
  toolsAdded: [nextRead],
  timestamp: now,
};
```

System sections are registered by stable, non-integer-like key. Generation
prepares the desired rendered section values and effective tool roster, compares
them with the state obtained by replaying the active transcript, and appends a
positional `pi.system` baseline or delta.

Replay applies messages in transcript order. Non-empty `content` appends
instructions. A section string adds or replaces that name without moving an
existing section; `null` removes it, and a later re-addition appends it to the
ordered section map. Within one message, tool removals happen before additions,
so a same-name replacement gets the new declaration and position.

A PR #9548 `SystemMessage` is always a patch, not a reset: it cannot remove
previous `content` or restore section order merely by restating current values.
Therefore, when a head removes the previous request-visible baseline, the new
`pi.system` entry adds `ContextEdit` omissions for every earlier `pi.system`
entry still retained after the cut. Its own message is then a complete baseline
containing the base `content`, every desired section in order, and every effective
tool declaration. Model-context replay sees the new baseline instead of the
omitted retained deltas. Otherwise preparation emits only changed section
values, `null` removals, and tool additions/removals. Same-name tool replacements
remove before adding. Registry or document changes while preparation hooks run
cause preparation to retry against a new snapshot.

Conversation creation may seed section values or explicit removals. Preparation
uses a mutable section draft with get/set/delete/wrap; each throwing hook loses
only its own draft changes. The rendered strings stored in historical
`SystemMessage.sections` remain authoritative even if the current renderer
changes. Pi-ai decides whether to send the messages positionally to a capable
provider or fold them into one leading system message; Pico does not rewrite its
stored transcript for provider compatibility.

### 7.4 Host plugin reload

A host plugin generation is the Session-side code implementing its task kinds,
hooks, tools, entry kinds, sections, and document definitions. Registration APIs
may change declarations during normal product operation, but they do not make
replacement of that implementation code safe while its callbacks are running.

In v1, changing host plugin code is a Harness generation boundary:

1. Stop new admission and task reservation.
2. Close the Harness, signalling and joining its active task, tool, and hook
   invocations without writing abort marks or terminal outcomes.
3. Dispose the old facets and registrations.
4. Construct a new Harness over the same storage.
5. Register the complete new definition set before open performs task/document
   migration and orphan reconciliation.
6. Resume scheduling from the durable checkpoints.

A durable task does not need to become terminal before this restart; only its
current invocation must settle. A task definition must increase its version when
the meaning of persisted input or checkpoint state changes and migrate supported
older state. Uncommitted hook work may rerun under the new generation; committed
memos remain part of the live task.

If old plugin code ignores cancellation and never settles, graceful in-process
reload cannot complete. The host must terminate that isolated worker/process
before opening the Session under the new generation. Old and new generations
must never own the same Session concurrently.

Generation-pinned registries that drain old callbacks while routing new work to
new code, plus explicit compatible task takeover, are possible future work. Safe
forced takeover of arbitrary non-cooperative JavaScript requires worker/process
isolation and is not a v1 promise.

## 8. Built-in tasks

The initial implementation provides:

| kind | responsibility |
|---|---|
| generation | prepare system/loadout, request or poll model, retry, classify response |
| tool | validate, hook, execute, persist progress, append result |
| post-tools | wait for tools, apply controls, run boundary, continue generation |
| collapse | select a transcript range, summarize, append a headed summary |
| job | run a process, persist bounded output, delay or reschedule |
| plugin | run a registered durable handler when needed |

Generation and tool progress are throttled durable document commits. A crash may
lose only the uncommitted throttle window. Recovery converts committed partials
to normal interrupted/aborted transcript entries, clears presentation state,
and then retries or terminates according to the task phase. Retry deadlines,
attempts, compaction, and tool progress are current document state for late
joiners; completed-attempt usage/accounting is an entry or terminal detail.
Bounded output records whether content was truncated and any retained file path.

Compaction changes model context by appending a summary entry with a head. It
does not delete transcript history.

The initial job implementation does not promise process reattachment after a
harness crash. It preserves checkpointed output, records interruption, and may
rerun only when its explicit job policy allows it. Delayed and recurring jobs
use durable deadlines and create/transition tasks; they do not rely on timers
surviving process death.

## 9. Document observation and Chord

### 9.1 Document source

```ts
declare const documentSourceType: unique symbol;
interface DocumentSource<T extends JsonObject> {
  readonly [documentSourceType]: T;
}

interface DocumentWatch<T extends JsonObject> {
  readonly value: Readonly<T>;
  readonly revision: number;
  start(listener: (
    value: Readonly<T> | null,
    ops: readonly Op[],
    revision: number,
    context: Context,
  ) => void): void;
  stop(): void;
}

interface DocumentObserver {
  watchDoc<T extends JsonObject>(token: DocToken<T>, target: DocTarget, context: Context): Promise<DocumentWatch<T>>;
  watchDoc<T extends JsonObject, I extends JsonValue>(token: DocFamilyToken<T, I>, target: FamilyTarget<I>, context: Context): Promise<DocumentWatch<T>>;
}
```

`DocumentSource` is opaque. Pico5 adds this adapter at the Chord boundary:

```ts
interface ReplicatedDocument<T extends JsonObject> {
  readonly state: ReplicatedState<T | null>;
  dispose(): void;
}

function documentReplicatedState<T extends JsonObject>(
  source: DocumentSource<T>,
  context: Context,
): Promise<ReplicatedDocument<T>>;
```

The adapter registers the source with Chord and exposes it without a second
tracker or re-diff. Normal source and watch acquisition are get-or-create and
bind one concrete incarnation. Retirement publishes a JSON `null` replacement
and ends that incarnation's stream. The service may then withdraw itself; if it
remains exposed, consumers see `null`, never stale state. A later recreation
requires acquiring a new source/watch.

Each document source has a contiguous revision independent of the sparse global
Session commit sequence. Hydration atomically captures matching value/revision
and subscribes before releasing the Session line.

### 9.2 `watchDoc`

Tasks, hooks, and tools may observe any document for which their code has a token
and target. There is no additional subtree permission system inside trusted
Session code.

`watchDoc()` is available on task, hook, and tool APIs. It atomically registers
the internal listener and captures the current value/revision on the Session
line. It returns a stopped delivery surface:

```ts
const watch = await api.watchDoc(JobOutputDoc, target, context);
consume(watch.value);
watch.start((value, ops) => consume(value, ops));
```

Updates between capture and `start()` are buffered in order without a fixed
bound. `start()` drains them and continues live delivery. `stop()` discards the
buffer and is idempotent. Watches acquired by an invocation stop when it ends;
watches acquired from `Session` are caller-owned and stop on `Session.close()`.
Listener failures are isolated and cannot affect committed state or other
listeners. Retirement delivers `null` with `["r", null]`, the JSON
representation of document absence.

### 9.3 Conversation view

The public view is a fixed structural mount of selected built-in documents:

```ts
type ConversationView = {
  readonly conversation: Conversation;
  readonly entries: readonly Entry[];
  readonly docs: Readonly<Record<string, JsonObject>>;
};
```

The concrete built-in document IDs and fields are public protocol once their
implementation layer is approved. Third-party documents are initially exposed
through their own Chord services, not automatically mounted.

The mount consumes one complete Session commit and publishes one Chord batch:

```text
document op ["s", ["message"], value]
-> view op ["s", ["docs", "pi.live", "message"], value]
```

Entry appends/head changes and every changed mounted document are included in
the same publication. The mount owns no tracker and performs no semantic
projection. Its revision is contiguous per view.

## 10. Storage contract

Ordered scans are cursor-based. Exact identity lookups are keyed.

```ts
type Page<T, C> = {
  readonly items: readonly T[];
  readonly next?: C;
};

type Cursor<K extends string> = string & { readonly __kind?: K };
type ConversationCursor = Cursor<"conversation">;
type EntryCursor = Cursor<"entry">;
type TaskCursor = Cursor<"task">;
type DocumentCursor = Cursor<"document">;

type EntryQuery = {
  readonly conversationId: Id;
  readonly before?: Id;       // strict semantic cutoff, independent of page cursor
  readonly kind?: string;
  readonly withHead?: boolean;
};

type TaskQuery = {
  readonly conversationId?: Id;
  readonly kind?: string;
  readonly status?: "pending" | "running" | "terminal";
  readonly abortRequested?: boolean;
  readonly background?: boolean;
};

type DocumentQuery = {
  readonly definitionId?: string;
  readonly scope?: DocumentIdentity["scope"];
  readonly instanceId?: string;
  readonly at?: Seq | "current";
  readonly includeRetired?: boolean;
};

type StoredDocumentRecord =
  | { readonly seq: Seq; readonly version: number; readonly kind: "base"; readonly value: JsonObject }
  | { readonly seq: Seq; readonly version: number; readonly kind: "delta"; readonly ops: readonly Op[] };

type StoredDocument = {
  readonly metadata: DocumentMetadata;
  readonly records: readonly [
    Extract<StoredDocumentRecord, { kind: "base" }>,
    ...Extract<StoredDocumentRecord, { kind: "delta" }>[],
  ];
};

type StorageWrite =
  | { readonly type: "conversation"; readonly value: Conversation }
  | { readonly type: "entry"; readonly value: Entry }
  | { readonly type: "task"; readonly value: Task<JsonValue, JsonValue, JsonValue> }
  | { readonly type: "input"; readonly value: Input }
  | {
      readonly type: "document.create";
      readonly identity: DocumentIdentity;
      readonly value: JsonObject; // always a base; storage stamps createdAt
    }
  | {
      readonly type: "document.change";
      readonly metadata: DocumentMetadata;
      readonly definition: AnyDocToken;
      readonly ops: readonly Op[];
      readonly value: JsonObject;
      readonly base: "checkpoint" | "required";
    }
  | { readonly type: "document.retire"; readonly id: Id };

interface Storage {
  commit(writes: readonly StorageWrite[], context: Context): Promise<Seq>;
  mintId(): Id;

  conversation(id: Id, context: Context): Promise<Conversation | undefined>;
  scanConversations(cursor: ConversationCursor | undefined, limit: number, context: Context): Promise<Page<Conversation, ConversationCursor>>;

  entries(ids: readonly Id[], context: Context): Promise<ReadonlyMap<Id, Entry>>;
  scanEntries(query: EntryQuery, cursor: EntryCursor | undefined, limit: number, context: Context): Promise<Page<Entry, EntryCursor>>;
  entryCommit(id: Id, context: Context): Promise<Seq | undefined>;

  task(id: Id, context: Context): Promise<Task<JsonValue, JsonValue, JsonValue> | undefined>;
  scanTasks(query: TaskQuery, cursor: TaskCursor | undefined, limit: number, context: Context): Promise<Page<Task<JsonValue, JsonValue, JsonValue>, TaskCursor>>;

  input(id: Id, context: Context): Promise<Input | undefined>;
  inputByRequest(conversationId: Id, requestId: string, context: Context): Promise<Input | undefined>;

  document(id: Id, at: Seq | "current", context: Context): Promise<StoredDocument | undefined>;
  scanDocuments(query: DocumentQuery, cursor: DocumentCursor | undefined, limit: number, context: Context): Promise<Page<DocumentMetadata, DocumentCursor>>;

  close(context: Context): Promise<void>;
}
```

`EntryQuery` supports conversation ancestry, a strict `before` entry cursor,
kind filtering, and `withHead`. Document queries support definition, scope,
instance, current/as-of membership, and retired membership. Task queries support
conversation, kind, live/terminal
status, abort mark, and background status.

`document(id, at)` returns the newest applicable base plus its ordered delta tail
or an equivalent detached materialization. It never scans unrelated documents.

The semantic conformance suite covers memory, SQLite, and JSONL.

## 11. Backends

### 11.1 Memory

Memory storage is the reference semantics. It copies retained write values and
all read results. It preserves rewindable records and reclaims latest records
only after a committed base or retirement.

### 11.2 SQLite

One SQL transaction is one Session commit. SQLite stores:

- conversation, entry, task, and input records;
- document metadata;
- indexed document bases/deltas by document and commit sequence.

Live task transitions replace one row. Terminal tasks remain as small records.
Document reads use indexed base-plus-tail ranges. The first implementation stores
Chord records directly; it does not translate generic operations to SQLite JSON
functions.

Schema shape, WAL checkpoint cadence, and synchronous defaults are backend
implementation choices validated by conformance, reopen, query-plan, and storage
benchmarks.

### 11.3 JSONL

JSONL uses reclaimable sidecars without exposing them to the harness:

```text
main.jsonl       table writes, lifecycle, and one marker per commit
doc-<id>.jsonl   one document incarnation
task-<id>.jsonl  live task replacements
```

Publication protocol:

1. Append complete prepared records to every affected sidecar.
2. Append one complete main marker listing those records.
3. Publish in memory only after the marker write succeeds.

Every commit uses this protocol; there is no standalone-sidecar fast path.
Without `fsync`, it guarantees ordinary process-crash consistency, not survival
of power, host, kernel, or filesystem failure. Durable mode flushes sidecars
before the marker.

Recovery:

- Remove torn final lines.
- Ignore and remove unconfirmed sidecar tails.
- Apply confirmed records only.
- Missing required confirmed data is corruption and opening fails.
- A later committed latest base or retirement may prove an earlier physical
  record unnecessary.
- Any uncertain append failure poisons the open backend.

Reclamation starts only after the authorizing base/retirement commits. It writes
a temporary replacement, renames it, and invalidates cached file descriptors so
future appends cannot target an unlinked inode. `main.jsonl` is not compacted in
the initial implementation.

## 12. API footguns

These are contracts, not invitations to add defensive machinery:

- **Draft escape:** `tx.doc()` values, nested proxies, and array methods are valid
  only during that transaction. Retaining them can contaminate a later commit.
- **Inserted aliases:** after assigning an object or array into a draft, do not
  mutate the original value. The tracker owns it.
- **Read after write:** read every required table row before the first table
  write. Document drafts remain usable afterward; table reads do not.
- **Long transactions:** an async commit callback holds the Session mutation
  line. Never await models, tools, processes, network calls, humans, a nested
  Session commit, or a Session waiter inside it. Use methods on the current `Tx`.
- **Get-or-create reads:** `snapshot()` and `documentSource()` can create and
  commit an absent document. They are not historical or side-effect-free reads.
- **Family initialization:** `initial` input is used only for a new incarnation.
  It does not update an existing instance.
- **Checkpoint starvation:** if `checkpointWhen()` never returns true, replay
  and current-only document storage can grow without bound while the document is
  live.
- **Wrong fork setting:** `current`, `initial`, and `asOf` are product semantics,
  not optimizations. Changing one changes child conversation behavior.
- **Schema stability:** definition IDs, mounted document IDs, and visible paths
  are persisted/public protocol. Value migration cannot rename an ID; an ID
  change requires explicit copy and retirement.
- **Unstarted watches:** `watchDoc()` buffers every committed update until
  `start()` or `stop()`. Delaying both can consume unbounded memory.
- **Durable progress cadence:** clients see only committed progress. A crash may
  lose the current uncommitted throttle window.
- **Large terminal results:** terminal task records remain queryable. Put large
  results in entries or longer-lived documents and retain only their IDs in the
  outcome. Never reference a task-scoped document retired by that same outcome.
- **Raw transcript:** view entries are not model context. Rendering edits,
  display-only entries, and model filtering require the appropriate reducer.
- **Fatal storage errors:** after an uncertain storage failure the Session is
  poisoned. Do not catch the error and continue using it.
- **JSONL durability:** default JSONL ordering handles ordinary process crashes;
  without durable mode it does not promise acknowledged commits survive power or
  host failure.

- visible-undurable publication;
- public semantic event stream;
- transaction membrane;
- session-scoped rewindable documents;
- automatic checkpoint heuristic;
- automatic third-party view mounting;
- CRDT/offline multi-writer merge;
